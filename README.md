# The Enlightenment — pimecineng.com
Static artist website for GitHub Pages (HTTPS) with Spotify + Apple Music embeds and a Smart Links page.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a **public** repo (e.g., `enlightenment-site`) and upload these files.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to `Deploy from a branch`, **Branch** = `main` (root).
3. Ensure `CNAME` contains `pimecineng.com` at the repo root (included).
4. Point DNS to GitHub Pages. Enable **Enforce HTTPS** when available.

## Customize
- Replace `/assets/hero.jpg` and `/assets/favicon.png` with your images.
- Newsletter form in `contact.html` uses Formspree demo — swap with your endpoint.
- Streaming links are wired to Legacy In Motion on Spotify and Apple Music.
